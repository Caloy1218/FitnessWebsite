            <p>My name is Carlo/Caloy, and I've been a dedicated personal trainer for over five years. I began my fitness journey at 18 and never looked back.
            <br/>
            My mission is to help individuals achieve their best selves, whether that means losing weight, building muscle, or improving overall fitness. To fully embrace life, we must change our mindsetâ€”positivity is essential.
